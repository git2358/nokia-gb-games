# Copy the built ROMs to the root of the flash carts' SD cards: the .gb to
# the two EZ-Flash Junior cards and to the EZ-Flash Omega Definitive
# Edition card, whose built-in Game Boy emulator runs it (with the Omega's
# motor, to try the rumble), and the .gba to the Omega card.
#
# Usage: scripts/copy-to-cards.sh [ROM...]
#
# With no arguments it takes every .gb and .gba in build/ except the
# scripted test ROMs (*-keys.*) and the benchmark (*-bench.*). A card that is not mounted is skipped with
# a note, and the rest are still done. Each copy is compared with its
# source afterwards. Nothing is ejected.
#
# A .gba without the boot logo is not copied: a console refuses it. The
# build copies the logo from a ROM it finds (common/tools/gbafix.py), or
# from `make gba GBA_LOGO_FROM=/path/to/some.gba`.
#
# Exit status: 0 when every ROM reached every mounted card it belongs on
# and at least one card was there; 1 when a copy failed, a ROM was refused,
# or no card was mounted.
