/* Game Boy layer. The core's framebuffer is the whole 160x144 screen, shown
   as a 20x18 block of background tiles, one tile per 8x8 cell; the phone's
   96x65 LCD is a window in the middle of it, on whole tiles. In the menus
   A, Select or Start is the phone's Navi key, B is its C key and the D-pad
   scrolls; Start on the first screen picks the full-screen variant, whose
   menus fill the screen. In the game the D-pad steers, A turns clockwise,
   B anticlockwise, and Start or Select pauses.

   This file is in the ROM's first 16 KiB with the rest of what every part
   of the program needs; far.c says what is in the other banks. */
