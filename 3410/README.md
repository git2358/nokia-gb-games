# Nokia 3410 games for Game Boy

![The first screen, the Select game list and Snake II being played on the Game Boy, at the phone's size and in full screen, where Snake II has its bigger board; Space Impact, Bumper, Bantumi and Link5's panels are blank, as they are not here yet](docs/banner.png)

The Nokia 3410 (NHM-2 v5.46) follow-up to the [3310's](../3310/README.md): the 3410's built-in games
re-implemented in C from a map of the firmware, with their data read from
your own dump at build time. One portable core runs on the host and as a
Game Boy ROM (`.gb`); a GBA build is to come.

What is there so far:

- the phone's menus: the main menu's Games entry, Games (Select game and
  Settings; not the phone's Download game and More games), the Select game
  list with all five games, and Snake II's own menu with New game, High
  scores, Options (Game options: the six mazes and the nine levels) and
  Instructions, drawn with the phone's fonts and text. The Select game
  list, Snake II's menu, Game options, the mazes, the Level page, the title,
  the game-over picture and the High scores page equal the phone's to the
  pixel;
- Snake II: the 3410's game, the 3310's on a 23 by 13 board with the mazes
  redrawn, its creatures, scoring, speeds and the dead snake's blinking,
  frame for frame as the phone plays it; its title animation, and the
  game-over picture with the score in its box, blinking for a new top
  score, kept for each maze as on the 3410; and the High scores page with
  its boxes and the snake that eats a creature on its way across;
- Space Impact: the 3410's game, the 3310's rebuilt on the 3410's
  graphics library with its eight chapters in a file, frame for frame as
  the phone plays it through every chapter, its bosses and game over; its
  title, its menu (Continue after a pause, New game, High scores,
  Chapters, Instructions) and its High scores page, all to the pixel. The
  Instructions are the phone's text without its demos, and the Chapters
  note "Done" is there without its tick. On the Game Boy the game keeps
  the phone's pace but shows a picture about every other tick, about five
  a second, where the phone shows ten;
- the games' Settings (Game sounds, Game lights, Shakes, Club Nokia ID),
  the vibrator as a rumble motor (from a death to the second blink, as on
  the 3410, but half as long, see `../common/core/rumble.h`), and the 3310's eat and death sounds, which the 3410 holds too
  but which have not been checked against it yet;
- the top score and the chosen level and maze, kept in battery-backed
  cartridge RAM.

Not yet: Bumper, Bantumi and Link5, Space Impact's sounds, vibrator and
Instructions demos, the main menu's Games icon and the lists' sliding
highlight.

The game is shown at the phone's size, in the middle of the Game Boy's
screen. Start on the first screen picks the full-screen variant, whose
menus fill the screen and in which Snake II is played on a bigger board:
the phone's own rule for the board's size applied to the Game Boy's
screen, 39 by 33 cells, with the snake, the food, the creatures and the
score at the phone's size and speed, the mazes moved out in proportion to
fill it, and top scores of its own.

| | Menus | Snake II | Space Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-pad | up and down | steer (2, 4, 6, 8) | fly (8, 0, *, #) |
| A | select | turn clockwise (#) | fire (1) |
| B | back | turn anticlockwise (*) | special weapon (4) |
| Start, Select | select | pause | pause |

## Building

`make dump` makes the flash image from the Wintesla files below (it needs
the RE fork, in whose `ports/` directory this repository is kept, or
`DCT3_RE=` pointing at it; from here it is `../../..`), `make gb` the ROM, `make run-gb` opens it in SameBoy. `make test` runs the host
checks; `make check-gb` runs the ROM headlessly against the host's frames.
`make golden-snake` and `make golden-si` record Snake II and Space Impact
games in the fork's MAME and `make check-golden` replays them through the
core; `make check-menus` compares
the menu pages with the phone's in `golden/menus/`.

## Firmware policy

No Nokia firmware, no extracted code or data from it, and nothing derived
from a firmware image is committed here. `roms/`, run output and build
output are ignored.

That being said I got my firmware at firmware center
<https://firmware.center/firmware/Nokia/3410%20%28NHM-2%29/Flash%20Files/NHM-2%20v.05.46%203410.rar>

## Dump

Put the Wintesla flash files of NHM-2 v5.46 in `roms/3410-nhm2-v546/`:

| file | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `NHM2NX05.460` (MCU) | `713c6de148eabd907b3eefd4dd43637279b621eb2c94bed09385e9dc4094693f` |
| `NHM2NX05.46E` (PPM E) | `779b3c13726a5878a117eed9e91d021597bc4d74dedeb1dba26e9335df1ee633` |
| `3410 virgin eeprom.pmm` | `35cf261f9aacae40ad2b95f6646be2b07220e92c8b6c119f958c6bc5e929a632` |

For now the RE fork's `make normalize-3410` lays them out for MAME:

| output in `roms/noki3410/` | size | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| `3410f546e.fls` | `0x370000` | `4b0e815a07dc18b3b5f1cff1134de55aa514eaa7ce5a0eecc44a270867562b04` |
| `3410 virgin eeprom 005f0000.fls` | `0x90000` | `f00f6974a6c03846ed1109e55d76e336e55767c2954be4ea2ae36687260a5863` |

Munkiki's Castles is a JAR inside the PMM (40888 bytes, SHA-256
`e94f9c942968acfadd13e19c62fc0aa8e48f0758a2ec00f2a9ba42269433caf8`),
kept locally as `roms/munkikis_castles.jar`.
